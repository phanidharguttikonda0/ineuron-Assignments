/*

Are Higher Order functions and Call back functions the same ? If not,
briefly explain about both functions.

HigherOrder Functions are the Functions Which takes another function as argument and or 
returns the function to it's caller..
Where as the Call back Functions are the Functions which are passed function as an argument..

 function a(b){
    b() ;
 }

 a(function(){
    console.log('hii) ;
 }) ;

 The function we are passing to the a is an call back function ... if a takes an function as
 the argument then a is said to be Higher Order Function...

We can say No they both  are not same , because a call back function is an normal function
just like other functions but the higher order functions which takes the another function 
as an argument ... But sometimes an call back function can be an Higher Order Function because
it may also takes the function as an argument....
