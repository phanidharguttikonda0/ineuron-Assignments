/**
 * for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      setTimeout(function log() {
         console.log(i); // What is logged?
         }, 1000);
      }

      output -> 3,3,3...
      The setTimeout will pass the function and the time and after the time has been
      completed the closure was created ... if the closure was created before the 
      time was completed means when setTimeout was called then the out put should be 1,2,3...
      But that's not the case here...
